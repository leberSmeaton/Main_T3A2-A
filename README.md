To meet calls and pressure that local councils and the State Government aren't providing enough green space, Parks Victoria are creating a new inner city park database. For small and large parks alike!<br />
The **Picnic Victoria** app provides detailed park amenity information to help facilitate a family picnic to a skate park hangout.<br /><br />
**_A park is nothing without a picnic and nothing is better than a picnic in Vic!_** <br /><br />
Want to reach peak picnic? üç∑ + üßÄ = üß∫ <br/>

#### **Target Audience:**

![The Novak Family picture](./docs/TheNovaks.jpg)
**Who:** The Novaks. 'The Nuclear Family, with dog'. Two parents. Two Children. One puppy. <br />
**Age:** Parents are late twenties to late thirties, 28-38. One child is of primary school age 7, and one two year old. <br />
**Occupation:** One stay at home parent, the other working 9-5. Children are young learners.<br />
**Nationality:** Slovenian Australians.<br />
**Income:** Lower middle Class, one income of 80k/annum. <br />
**Religion:** Non practicing/ 'lapsed Catholic'.<br />
**Location:** Local resident. Elsternwick, 3185. South-Eastern Suburbs. <br />
**Living circumstances:** Smaller townhouse with no garden.<br />
**What is the problem this Target Audience needs solving?**<br />
The Novaks have a young family and no backyard, so they spend a lot of their family time outside of the home to entertain their young children. They go for walks with their dog so they also need parks that allow for dogs and an off leash area. Picnics are a regular occurrence for the Novaks. <br />
As a family they have a lot of needs that have to be met for an enjoyable picnic. Their number 1 problem is that most parks near them don't have toilet / change table facilities and a playground. They wish they had the ability to look this up so they don't have to arrive disappointed.
Their ultimate park is one that has a toilet, cover from the sun, a playground and dog park. An 'all-in-one' park scenario. Their lower grade park might be one they take their dog to for a short morning walk. <br />

**Who:** Glenn B. Single male<br />
**Age:** 25 years old<br />

**Religion:** Agnostic<br />
**Location:** Werribee, 3030. Western Suburbs<br />
**Living circumstances:** Currently renting in a small unit and small backyard<br />
**What is the problem this Target Audience needs solving?**<br />
Glenn is a person in his mid 20s. With a small backyard at his rental, he will usually go out and explore the nearby park or reserve to get some fresh air. He is quite keen to visit and explore new places
<br />
The problem that Glenn have are two fold: <br />1. Finding the right park with right facilities. Many times, he has tried to find information on the a particular park, only to find that park does not have the correct facilities. Glenn has run into this problem many times, especially when it comes to working with special needs children, whereby the park does not have a playground or toilet facilities. 2. Finding a different variety of parks. As someone who loves exploring and as a special needs support worker, Glenn feel that some parks around his area are quite underwhelming, and would like to find a way to distinguish and filter out parks, based on what they have to offer.

1. Living in a sharehouse with three other people, Ramona would like to get out of the house and expand her social circle within the skateboarding or skating community.
2. Ramona is a busy person, so having an app that would give her quick and easy information on the types of skateparks available in her local vicinity would be ideal. As she is a budding skateboarder, Ramona would also like to share and find community reviews of the skateparks in her area. This is so she is able to organise meetups and learn with skaters of different backgrounds and experience.

## **Project Management:**

<!-- State chosen standards and planning methodology -->

Picnic Victoria chose a Kaban workflow management system as their chosen agile management style, specifically for it's simplified visualisation of the team work load. <br />

Individual developers manage their code and their workflow where it is _code reviewed_ before raising the pull request. This was specifically helpful in this documentation stage where all the team needs to be across the entire breadth of functionality and features. <br />

One thing that the team did not implement but will implement in Part B are deadlines on cards. Part A's due date was close enough and everyones social and work calendar too complicated to assign dates. The team worked together in a regard to not require such stringent reminders, but have assessed the need for it in Part B.

Kaban features include:

- Card rating system: low, medium, high.
- Adding members to cards.
  ![Image one kaban style projectment](./docs/Kaban_detail_1.png)
- Watching necessary cards,
- Comments,
- attachments to ensure links to other softwares are easily accessible,
  ![Image one kaban style projectment](./docs/Kaban_detail_2.png)
- Checklists: Completed/Code Reviewed/Raised Pull Request,
